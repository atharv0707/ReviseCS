    <h1>Types of Program Translators</h1>
    <p>Program translators are essential components in the software development process, responsible for converting high-level programming languages into machine-readable code. AQA A Level Computer Science syllabus emphasizes understanding the roles of three main types of program translators: assembler, compiler, and interpreter.</p>
    <h4>Assembler</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>assembler</strong> is a program translator that converts assembly language code into machine code. Assembly language is a low-level programming language specific to a particular computer architecture. Assemblers are crucial for translating human-readable assembly code into the binary language that the computer's CPU can execute directly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compiler</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>compiler</strong> is a program translator that translates the entire high-level source code into machine code before execution. This process, called compilation, results in the creation of an executable file. Compilers are known for their ability to detect errors in the entire program before execution, providing efficient and optimized machine code.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Interpreter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>An <strong>interpreter</strong> translates high-level source code into machine code line by line during program execution. Unlike compilers, interpreters do not produce a separate executable file. They are advantageous for debugging, as errors can be identified and corrected on-the-fly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Compilation vs. Interpretation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding the differences between <strong>compilation and interpretation</strong> is crucial. Compilation involves translating the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in an executable file. Interpretation, on the other hand, translates code line by line during runtime without creating a standalone executable.</li>
        <li>Situations in which <strong>compilation is appropriate</strong> include scenarios where performance optimisation is critical, as compiled code tends to be faster. Interpretation is suitable when flexibility and ease of debugging are priorities, as errors can be identified and corrected in real-time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Intermediate Language (Bytecode)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Some compilers produce an <strong>intermediate language such as bytecode</strong> as the final output. Bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of the source code. It is subsequently used by an interpreter, called a virtual machine, which executes the program. This approach allows for cross-platform compatibility without the need for recompilation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Source and Object Code</h4>

    <p>Understanding the <strong>difference between source and object (executable) code</strong> is fundamental. Source code is the human-readable version of the program written in a high-level language. Object code, also known as executable code, is the machine-readable output generated by the compiler or assembler.</p>
