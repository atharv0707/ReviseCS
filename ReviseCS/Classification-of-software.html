    <h1>Classification of software</h1>
    <h4>Hardware:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that you can touch and feel.
            These include the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM and storage), input/output devices
            (keyboard, mouse, monitor), and peripheral devices (printer, scanner, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>Hardware components are essential for the functioning of a computer system.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Software:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li> Software is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform specific tasks. It is intangible and includes programs, applications, and the operating system.</li>
        <li>Software is designed to interact with hardware to provide a platform for running applications and managing the overall functionality of the computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Relationship:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Hardware and software are interdependent; they rely on each other to perform tasks and functions.</li>
        <li>Hardware provides the platform for software to run, and software, in turn, utilises the capabilities of hardware to execute tasks efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>System Software:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>System software is a type of software designed to manage and control the hardware components of a computer system. It provides a foundation for running application software.</li>
        <li>Examples of system software include operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Device drivers that enable communication between hardware and the operating system are also considered system software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Application Software:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for the user. It is user-focused and includes programs like word processors, web browsers, games, and multimedia applications.</li>
    <li>Unlike system software, application software is not essential for the basic functioning of the computer but adds functionality and utility to the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Understanding the Need for Different Types of Software</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>System software is crucial for managing hardware resources and providing a user interface.</li>
        <li>Application software meets user needs and is diverse, catering to various tasks and requirements.</li>
        <li>Different types of software serve specific purposes, enhancing the overall capabilities of a computer system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Attributes of Different Types of Software:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>System software is typically more complex and interacts closely with the hardware.</li>
    <li>Application software is designed for ease of use and specific functionalities.</li>
        <li>Both types of software undergo updates and improvements to enhance performance and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In conclusion, understanding the relationship between hardware and software, as well as the classification and attributes of different types of software, is fundamental to comprehending how computer systems operate and how they can be effectively utilised for various tasks.<p>
